# Changelog

Ember uses calendar versions in `YEAR.MONTH.DAY` form without zero-padding.
Release notes record user-visible features, fixes, compatibility changes,
upgrade steps, and validated hardware. Git tags add a `v` prefix; for example,
version `2026.8.9` is tagged `v2026.8.9`.

`VERSION` is authoritative. Ember publishes at most one release per calendar
day; additional fixes remain on `main` until the next dated release rather than
using an ambiguous same-day suffix.

## 2026.8.9

- Prepared the first source release.
- Added a one-command Docker Compose workflow with resumable model download.
- Pinned the default model revision and added expected-size, free-space, and
  SHA-256 checks before startup.
- Added host/container preflight diagnostics, Compose health reporting, and
  read-only plus generation smoke tests.
- Added OCI image metadata and operations/upstream-release guidance.
- Split the container into a full-toolchain `dev` target and a minimal
  dependency-closure `release` target used by Compose.
- Added licensing, vendor provenance, security, support, and contribution policy.
- Synced the latest agent-progress work: repeated-call diagnostics, a
  result-based progress lease, empty/degenerate-turn telemetry, and detection
  of tool markup delivered as visible text.
- Added opt-in stateless automatic loop recovery and Compose environment
  controls for progress reporting and recovery thresholds.
